# EIP-7910 eth_config JSON-RPC Method

## TL;DR

- Adds a new **JSON-RPC** method called `eth_config`

- Lets you ask a node: *“What chain/fork settings are you running now, what’s next, and what was last?”*

- Designed so operators and monitoring tools can verify configs across nodes and catch mistakes before they cause forks

## How it works

- **Method name:** "eth_config"

- **Takes:** no arguments

- **Returns:** an object with three parts:

    - `current` → the config active right now

    - `next` → the config of the *upcoming fork* (if one exists)

    - `last` → the config of the *previous fork* (if any)

If no future or past fork exists, those fields are `null`.

## What’s inside each config

Each config (`current`, `next`, `last`) is a JSON object containing:

- **activationTime** — Unix timestamp when the fork kicks in

- **chainId** — the network’s chain ID (hex)

- **forkId** — 4-byte fork hash from EIP-6122

- **blobSchedule** — blob gas parameters (`max`, `target`, `baseFeeUpdateFraction`). Used for blob-only forks (EIP-7892)

- **precompiles** — list of active precompile contracts (name → address)

- **systemContracts** — system-level contracts like deposit contract or beacon roots

⚠️ Even if only one field changes at a fork, the node returns the full config (not just a diff). This avoids hidden misconfigs

## Example call

Request:

```json
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_config","id":1}
```

Response(shortened):

```json
    {
  "result": {
    "current": {
      "activationTime": 0,
      "chainId": "0x88bb0",
      "forkId": "0xbef71d30",
      "precompiles": { "ECREC": "0x01", "SHA256": "0x02" },
      "systemContracts": { "BEACON_ROOTS_ADDRESS": "0x000f3d..." }
    },
    "next": { ... upcoming fork ... },
    "last": null
  }
}
```

## Why it matters

- **Consistency checks:** Operators and monitoring tools can compare outputs across nodes to ensure they’re aligned

- **Fork safety:** Detects when one node is misconfigured (wrong deposit address, wrong fork block, etc.) before it causes chain splits

- **Future-proof:** Supports blob-only parameter updates (EIP-7892), system contracts, and new fields introduced by later forks

## Security / Ops notes

- Don’t expose this openly: it leaks chain config details. Keep it for trusted interfaces

- Nodes may lie (malicious or buggy). Cross-check multiple sources

- Clients can cache the response, but must refresh at fork transitions

- Heavy polling should be avoided → rate limiting is recommended

## Summary

`eth_config` is a new RPC method that lets you programmatically query a node’s fork schedule and active configuration — past, present, and future — with all critical parameters spelled out in full.
