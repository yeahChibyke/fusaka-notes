# EIP-7825 - Transaction Gas Limit Cap

## TL;DR

It’s a proposal to put a hard ceiling on how much gas a single Ethereum transaction can use.
- The cap: 16,777,216 gas (2²⁴)
- If a transaction asks for more than this, it’s invalid (can’t go in the mempool or a block)
- The cap applies even if the block gas limit is higher

## Requirements 

Nil

## Purpose & Motivation

- **Prevent monster transactions:** Right now, one transaction can use almost the entire block’s gas limit. This can slow down block validation and make DoS attacks easier.
- **Keep execution predictable:** With a fixed ceiling, node operators know the worst-case cost of a single transaction.
- **Future scaling:** Sharding and parallel execution need “bounded work” per transaction. A cap makes transactions easier to parallelize.

## Expected Changes

- **Txpool / mempool:** Transactions asking for more than 16,777,216 gas are rejected
- **Blocks:** A block that includes such a transaction is invalid
- **All others:** Transactions below this limit work exactly as today

## Security benefits

- Stops DOS via huge transactions
- Faster and safer block validation
- ALigns with sharding and parallel execution

## Security risks and trade-offs

- **Breaking large txns:**
  - Contracts that expect huge gas budget may most likely fail
  - These contracts will need to split work across smaller txns
- **Splitting overhead:**
  - Splitting big jobs into many txs costs extra base gas (21k per tx) and repeated state warming
  - This adds a small but real inefficiency
- **Over-provisioning:**
  - Some transactions today set overly large gas limits “just in case”
  - If those exceed the cap, they’ll need to be corrected
- **Implementation mistakes:**
  - All clients (Geth, Nethermind, Besu, etc.) must enforce this uniformly
  - If one doesn’t, it risks a consensus split
